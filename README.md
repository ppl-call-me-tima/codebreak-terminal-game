So this is a small codebreak game, wherein a 4-digit code is generated which has unique digits. The aim is to guess the code using the help of the hints provided. 
The hints will be provided which will tell the codebreaker about the accuracy of the digits in the GUESS with respect to the CODE generated.
For Eg:

if   CODE = 1234

and  GUESS = 1567
HINT : 1 digits are at correct place.
       0 digits are at wrong place.
       
and GUESS = 5617
HINT : 0 digits are at correct place.
       1 digits are at correct place.
             
Using the hints, you have to guess the CODE.

PS - Ideally, number of guesses should be entered 10-12.
